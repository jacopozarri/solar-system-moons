For my project i would like to create a website that show a list all the moons for each planet, with an image and some description,
also since new moons are discovered each months or so i want to have a feature that allows to addmore moons and to update the existing one with new informations.
My idea it’s to write original content myself and improve it over time, a feature i would like to add in the future it’s for example to add secondary pictures for each moon.
I will use .NET to create the enpoint and an SQL and I will use React for the frontend.
